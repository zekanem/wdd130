   <p>Hello evryone, let me introduce myself. I'm single. I come from Akwa Ibom state in  Nigeria, West Africa. I am the first son of 3 sibling and 8 step sibling, much right!</p>
   <p>I am a computer and tech enthusiast, I believe this things are here to make life easier for us even though a lot of people misuse it. I also like seeing sci-fi movies, reading its books and playing soccer on video games.</p>
   <p>I joined the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints September last year and was also baptised. I must say this has been a rewarding experience for me all round.</p>
   <p>I am pursuing a degree in Business management at BYU-Idaho, I hope to use the knowledge to be gainfully employed or to create employment for others. I also want to be useful to my community and the Church. </p>
   <p>There is so much to say but I'll stop here and go through your own webpages. </p>
